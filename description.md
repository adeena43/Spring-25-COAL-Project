## Introduction
A console-based matrix calculator implemented in Assembly Language (MASM32) to perform fundamental and advanced matrix operations efficiently. Designed for educational purposes to demonstrate low-level programming concepts and numerical computations.

---

##  Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: MASM32 Assembly
- **Development Environment**: MASM32 SDK
- **Interface**: Console-based application

---

## Key Features

### Basic Operations
-  Matrix Addition 
-  Matrix Subtraction 
-  Matrix Multiplication 
-  Matrix Division (via inverse multiplication)

### Advanced Operations (2×2 & 3×3 Only)
-  Matrix Transpose
-  Determinant Calculation
-  Adjoint Matrix
- ⚙ Matrix Inverse (non-singular matrices only)

### General Features
-  Dynamic input handling for user-defined matrix sizes
-  Robust error handling for invalid inputs
-  Optimized memory management for large matrices

---

##  Design Approach
- **Modular Structure**:  
  Each operation (addition, subtraction, etc.) is implemented as an independent subroutine.
- **Memory Management**:  
  Matrix elements stored in MASM32 arrays with heap allocation.
- **I/O Handling**:  
  Console-based input with structured output formatting.
